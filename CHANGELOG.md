# Changelog

## Unreleased

- MCP tool layer (`organvm_engine.mcp`): pure, JSON-serializable wrappers
  exposing the five core CLIs (registry, governance, seed, metrics, dispatch)
  to the `organvm-mcp-server` without an MCP-SDK dependency. Includes a
  `MCP_TOOLS` manifest plus `list_tools()` / `call_tool()` for generic
  registration and dispatch.
- ci: Add CodeQL security analysis workflow (content-path-scoped triggers plus a
  weekly baseline scan) — satisfies the GRADUATED-tier `codeql` requirement of
  the Descent Protocol infrastructure audit.
- ci: Add publish-on-tag release workflow that validates the tag against the
  pyproject version, builds distributions, and publishes a GitHub Release —
  complements the existing release-drafter draft automation.
## 0.1.0 (2026-02-17)
